	* Migrate Related Error/ Migration Error:

	->http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/
		this is admin of django, represents super admin.

   cmd to solve migration error:

Flow Of Execution

	->"URLs.py" in default app.

     redirect to our app 
	->in urls.py (defualt app)
		from django.contrib import admin
		from django.urls import path, include

		urlpatterns = [
	        	path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  	        	path('',include('website.urls')),
		    ]

	-> Now "urls.py" file will be read by django.
	
	   -here we will define different path and their corresponding functions in "views.py".
	     eg.
		'urls.py' in website(app we created):

			from django.contrib import admin
			from django.urls import path, include
			from website import views

			urlpatterns = [
			    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
			    path('',include('website.urls')),
           		]

                 'views.py':
			from django.http import HttpResponse
			from django.shortcuts import render

			def home(request):
			    return HttpResponse("Home page it is")

			def aboutus(request):
			    return HttpResponse("About us page it is")

* Blank Path : 

	path('',include('website.urls')),

	- blank path is '' where we load home page.
------------------------------

in "URLs.py" of default app
	->add blank path in list-> 
		from django.contrib import admin
		from django.urls import path, include

		urlpatterns = [
		    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
		    path('',include('websiteurls.py')),
		]

	-Here we re saying do not go to default app template, 
	 goto websiteurls.py on blank path

Foundation Questions:

What is URL dispatcher?
what is MVTC arhitecture? What is MVT? what's the difference in them?
Which IP Django server uses to run application?
What is use of seetings.py file?
------------------------------------------
Framework :
	-when we use framework we use architecture to develop application
	-Application built using framework is more ROBUST, SECURE as compared to hard coded language.

* HTML, CSS is a client side scripting language.
	-we can run .html file simply by double click in browser.
	-NO need to install server.

* PHP 
	-is a server side scripting language.
*DJango
	-backend server-side web application framework.

* Why python framework is recommended?
	-integration of AI ML is easy .

---------------------------------------

Why Framework ?
	-applications built in framework are more robust and secure than hard coded language.
	-we follow architecture when we use framework for developing application.

---------------------------------------------

Language in Interview ?

	-must start in english.
	-if we troublig to much to answer in english then speak in hindi slowly.
	-"don't ask may is speak in hindi", interviwer can say NO.!!
--------------------------------------------

	URL Dispatcher:

	Django architecture:

	->when user starts django server (runs django project)
	->django server will first run "urls.py file" present in project folder.
	->then it will goto "views.py" file.
		views will contains actual logic.
		views will contains functions.

	->from view.py it will goto "model" and then to "template".


===============================---------
     Creating Django Project 

Documentation site:
	djangoproject.com
	to upgrade version
		-> --upgrade

	to upgrade pip
		-> pip install --upgrade pip

 step 1] install Django:    (open cmd)
	->pip install django


 step 2] install extension in VScode:
	->django by baptiste darthenay
	
		so that vs code will support django framework

 step 3] create Django project:
	->django-admin startproject projectName

	if above cmd is not working then use below given:

	->python -m django startproject projectName.

	
 step 4] to run Django Project:
	->cd> projectFolder
	->projectFolder> py manage.py runserver
		OR 
	->projectFolder> python manage.py runserver

-------------------------------

 ** Create App in  django project:


 -There must be atleast one app (means module) present in our project.

 -There is one defualt module (named same as project name) present in project in we create a django project.
 -The defualt module has "settings.py" file.	

 to create app:
	->py manage.py startapp website(appName)


** Configure the app

 -inside 'settings.py' ->Installed Apps = [] mention newly created app(here website)
	eg. 
	   INSTALLED_APPS = [
		    'django.contrib.admin',
		    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
		    'website.apps.WebsiteConfig',
		]

 -"settings.py":
	-project related settings.
 
 -"models.py":
	-this is where we cerate table.

 -"view.py":
	-

*ERROR : Pip is recognized as an internal or external command.

	->google search:

		by microsoft Intellisense.

	settings-> mouse scroll zoom


** NOTE:
	-python Django is 100% case sensitive.

	
** why framework:
	-framework is ready structure.
	-


** Hard Coded Coding:
	-project done with coding not using any framework.
	-No framework means coder has defined by him where to define function,
	where to do what, where to call what ..etc
	-new developers trouble first understanding the code.
	-in case of framework structure is already defined.

	-Faster Development : less manual coding required

	-Scaling is easy 


** Django:
	-Open Source
	-Scalable:
		very imp that's why python is that popular.
	-Using library/packages:
			-means using functions in library/packages.
	-OOP

	-Pththon can be used to built:
		-web application
		-computer software
		-DB management
		-Data Science
		-Machine Learning
		-Network Monitoring Softwares eg. Jio, Airtel.
		-Game Development.
		-Platform independent

**What is Virtual ENvironment:
	-when we want to use diffrenet software in same machine or
	different versions of same software
	that time we need to create vitual environment.
	in some folder we'll install the software ..the software will feel that it is working 
	in real time time environment.

** Question:

do you know Django?
	-if YES, he/she know settings, where to define function , etc.

we have to upload our site at domain name (NOT subdomain) :

cPanel->
	file manager->
		public_html

		here we other files as well-
			mail, 
			public_html,
			public_ftp,
			and folder for each subdomain.
			

-cgi/bin is default folder, wee can delete it.
-this folder is automatically created in our root directory.
-with the help of cgi-bin folder we can locate/identify our root directory.

What is bootstrap ?
What is need of bootstrap?
How we can use both internal css and inline css in one paragraph?
What is Responsive?


What is bootstrap ?
	-Bootstrap is framework(architecture/skeleton) of external Css.
	-Thousands of classes are given by bootstrap community.
	-which we use to make our page structure responsive.

Why, What is need of bootstrap?
	- we are using bootrap to create structure of responsive page.




*** Types of Sites/Applicaions:

-dynamic website

-static website

-Portal
 
-social networking sites.
	eng. facebook, instagram, twitter etc.
-directory listing sites. 
	e,g justdile
-mailing application
	r.g Gmail


-App
-Desktop Application
-Web application
-Online Application

ecommerce website vs normal website.

** Site Should be According to UI/UX .
	-User Interface and User Experience.


* NOTE: 
	1] Images download with extensions:
	-jpeg, jpg, png, jgif.
	NOTE: Don't Download image with extension .web
		that means it is web file its not image.
	
	2] Images name should NOT be too long.

	# SEO Related:

	3] Images Name should not MEANINGFULL.
	     eg.
		Slider 123, 123 etc are not recommended.
	4] "alt" is google recommended attribute.
		eg. <img src="img.jpg" alt="Web Development Service in Pune">

	5] "Google Crawler" scans images name & store it in its  database.

	
	6] Images should always be of high quality.

	7] slider should not have images more than 7-8
		as slider is usually on home page. more images will take more
		time to load home page.

Missed Bootstrap
---------------------------------------Day-12  8/March/23---------------------------------------
WHY CSS ? :
	-code reusability.
	-formatting

body section: 
	that we want to show in out page.
class creation:
	two types:
	1] using dot(.)
	2] using #
CSS Types:
	-inline - first preference
	-internal - code resusability
	-external  - share/use in multiple pages
		   - create folder named as css->create css file
		     standard name style.css	
		 - need to link external css file using link tag:
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text/css"/>
			type- attribute is optional.
			relation- attribute use to specify relation(type of file).
			
			
			
favicon image/icon image : shown in browser tab, before title.

bootstrap:

alt+z: shortcut key.



---------------------------------------Day-11  3/March/23---------------------------------------
HTML: Hypertext markup Language.

<!DOCTYPE html>
	-website run faster (speed increases a bit compare to direct using <html>)

<title></title> :
	-SEO point of view very important.
	-google first read this(title) then enters into page.
	-write catchy points here e.g. 10 best clg in pune.

section:
	-part between tag open and tag closed
	-html has 90% paired(open and close) tags.
	-single tag: no need to close e.g <br>, <hr>.
	-paired tag: need to close tag e.g <body>, <head>, etc.

heading tags:
	-there are 6 heading tags:-
		<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>.
	-<h1> : is very IMP SEO point of view


img src Tag:
	-use to display image.
	<img src=""/>
	NOTE:should take high quality hd images from client minimum(1000px/1000px).
		-.jpeg, .png is ok but .web is not ok.
		-should use open source images not copyright images.
	-thumb rule: we have to give height and wwidth to image in img src tag compulsarily.
			otherwise by defualt accroding image size img will be displayed.

	-for Responsiveness: width should always give in "%", height should always give in "pixels".
	-Viewport height -width 100 vw.




## NOTE : if you are getting horizontal scroll bar, that means site is not responsive.

Notes:


dedicated server : 
	- dedicated server is designed according to our need.
	- hostinger service providers create this dedicated server and provide us.
	- here we have dedicated server means- a server with its own CPU, RAM, and 	
	  other configuration.

VPS :
	- dedicated server is divided into small parts called as VPS.
	- e.g a dedicated server has 16gb RAM and it is divided into parts 
		each with 4gb RAM. each of this part is called as VPS.

** Q. is CPU shared among VPS

Shared Hosting : 
	- this VPS server is given to many(different) users that is called as shared hosting
	- i.e VPS is shared among multiple users. (e.g VPS with 4gb RAM is shared among multiple users)
	- with how many users it is shared that depends upon hosting service provider.

 	

Cloud Hosting : 
	-no down time.
	-can be said as advance version of VPS.

NOTE : 1.take domain name confirmation from client itself on whatsapp or emaill.
	2.just mention somewhere that we are taking shared hosting.	
	




below 100pages :- 1000rs
